## 1. What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?
My journey as a developer has mostly been here in Towson University and to be honest, everything is still kinda new to me, even now. 
As for what brought me to Computer Science, it was originally because I was indecisive in what I really want to do as a career, therefore
I chose Computer Science as in my mind, computers are one of the biggest necessity in any creative process nowadays and could be the 
gateway that I needed in order to step in to that world. The reason why I chose this class is because it seems intruguing after my experiences
in COSC 412, which pushed me into the enduring struggle of crash coursing myself in the process of web development, the crash course had lead to multiple instances 
of my face crashing the table so I decided that I need to learn the basics to at least reduce the number of table faceplants I will have so that I won't end up 
with a concussion too soon in the future. 
## 2. What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations?
My ideal career progression is to graduate, work in the field for a bit to get experiences and then move up to getting my masters, create my own
apps and then maybe at some point join in the process of making video games, with of course, a great lack of table faceplants during the progression.
## 3. What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?
I have some exepriences in programming with C, C++ and Java, although in my opinion, I think I might have lost touch with the C languages
and my Java skills are showing signs as well. Besides those, I also have very vague memories of Python and as for web programming, I still have 
pretty recent experiences with Javascript, Html, CSS with frameworks like Angular, Express, Mongod and a tiny bit of React. However, web development 
is still kind of frustrating for me and gifted me with the aforementioned table placeplants that might be potential cause for my decaying skills with
other languages.
